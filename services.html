                         Instead, we extend our services beyond this stage; our department of on-site transformer maintenance
                          is available to clients to keep up the efficiency and safety mechanisms of their transformers. Physically,
                           the working of a transformer can deteriorate due to normal wear and tear or any high-energy event which 
                           can lag the efficient performance of transformers. We here at Rajesh Transformers are equipped with high-quality
                            mechanisms and services to productively deal with the maintenance and servicing of transformers. Out facilities
                             both in the two units in Noida, Uttar Pradesh has an amazing set of experts and their professional staff who are
                              not only qualified with this technically advanced work but are also responsible in their job profiles with years
                         of on-hands experience.</p>
                    <h3>On-site Maintenance</h3>
                    <p>Our comprehensive program dealing with on-site maintenance of transformers is based on the standard SMC 
                        predictive power transformer maintenance system. We make it our priority to guarantee the strict implementation
                         of SMC predictive power transformer maintenance system on every step, the improvement in efficiency of the system 
                         both in parts and whole is ensured without any doubt. In addition to that, we follow up with considerable improvement 
                         in the safety limits of the transformers, it is our duty to create possibilities of minimum risks of hazards or mechanical
                          accidents due to poor engineering and/ or improper maintenance and servicing of the system.
                    </p>
                    <p>The SMC predictive power transformer maintenance system involves four stages, namely, ETP-1, ETP-2, ETP-3, and
                         ETP-4 to increase the efficiency of the transformer by minimising the risk of system Sainte through any mechanical upset.</p>
                    <ul class="repair-services-text">
                        <li>ETP-1 is based around three phase turns ratio and excitation current</li>
                        <li>ETP-2 deals with the polarization index of the transformer system, the insulation resistance, and 
                            the numbers and range of recovery voltage.</li>
                        <li>In stage 3, that is, ETP-3, the three phase windings resistance measurement is complete</li>
                        <li>Followed up by three phase short circuit impedance measurement in the stage of ETP-4</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Within reach transformer repair service with proper scheduling of visits as per your requirements
