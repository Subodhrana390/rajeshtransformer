                    <h2>Servicing on Site</h2>
                    <h3>All-round-Service</h3>
                    <p>Primarily, the existence of our services is not demarcated within the bounds of mere a onetime process. Instead, we extend our services beyond this stage; our department of on-site transformer maintenance is available to clients to keep up the efficiency and safety mechanisms of their transformers. Physically, the working of a transformer can deteriorate due to normal wear and tear or any high-energy event which can lag the efficient performance of transformers. We here at Rajesh Transformers are equipped with high-quality mechanisms and services to productively deal with the maintenance and servicing of transformers. Out facilities both in the two units in Noida, Uttar Pradesh has an amazing set of experts and their professional staff who are not only qualified with this technically advanced work but are also responsible in their job profiles with years of on-hands experience.</p>
                    <h3>On-site Maintenance</h3>
                    <p>Our comprehensive program dealing with on-site maintenance of transformers is based on the standard SMC predictive power transformer maintenance system. We make it our priority to guarantee the strict implementation of SMC predictive power transformer maintenance system on every step, the improvement in efficiency of the system both in parts and whole is ensured without any doubt. In addition to that, we follow up with considerable improvement in the safety limits of the transformers, it is our duty to create possibilities of minimum risks of hazards or mechanical accidents due to poor engineering and/ or improper maintenance and servicing of the system.
                    </p>
                    <p>The SMC predictive power transformer maintenance system involves four stages, namely, ETP-1, ETP-2, ETP-3, and ETP-4 to increase the efficiency of the transformer by minimising the risk of system Sainte through any mechanical upset.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>ETP-1 is based around three phase turns ratio and excitation current</li>
                        <li>ETP-2 deals with the polarization index of the transformer system, the insulation resistance, and the numbers and range of recovery voltage.</li>
                        <li>In stage 3, that is, ETP-3, the three phase windings resistance measurement is complete</li>
                        <li>Followed up by three phase short circuit impedance measurement in the stage of ETP-4</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Within reach transformer repair service with proper scheduling of visits as per your requirements and dynamic experience of our personnel are clear characteristics of what we intend to provide once you have placed your trust on us above all the other options you had at your fingertips.
